# Amazon-Sales-Data-Analysis
In this Project Amazon Sales Data from April 2022 to June 2022 is analyzed.
Data preprocessing and cleaning is carried out for further analysis.
Univariate and Multivariate Exploratory Data Analysis is carried in python to extract meaningful insights.
With the help of cleaned Data I have developed Tableau Dashboard that conveys important insights from data to end users in effective way.
I have used various graphs and charts like Bar graph, Highlight table, Bubble chart, Map visuals etc.. to represent insights visually.
